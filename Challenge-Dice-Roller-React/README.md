# Roll the Dice

For this exercise,  consider the following code:

```javascript
Math.floor( Math.random() * 6 + 1 )
```
this will provide a number from 1 to 6 each time it is called: [1,2,3,4,5,6]

## Challenge
Using a well thought out state tree and nested component structure, construct an application that rolls a die and keeps track of the numbers rolled.  Here is a wireframe to help you start planning your application:
