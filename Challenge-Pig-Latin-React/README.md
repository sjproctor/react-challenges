# Pig Latin Activity

In this activity we're going to create a Pig Latin application.  We'll use a React application as a template to run the code that we are going to write for Pig Latin.

## Pig Latin Stories
* As a user, I can type in a sentence to the Pig Latin application.
* As a user, when I click Submit, I see a translation of the sentence I entered into Pig Latin.
* As a user, the page is styled, and pleasing to use.

## Speaking Pig Latin
Not fluent in Pig Latin yet?  No problem, you'll pick it up in no time. [How to speak Pig Latin](http://www.wikihow.com/Speak-Pig-Latin)
* For words beginning with a vowel, add "way" to the end.
* For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end, and add "ay".
* If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!
* For words beginning with "y", treat "y" as a consonant.

# Mob Programming

Mob programming is a scaled up version of pair programming. There is still a driver at the keyboard, however, there may be two, alternating in typing the group's input. Everybody in the group contributes to the implementation.

**Some Best Practices**
* Change drivers every 30 minutes
* Make sure everyone understands what's going on at all times
* Take responsibility to stay engaged - ask questions, contribute ideas
* Take breaks together
* Help teammates stay engaged "Do you have any ideas.  Does that make sense to you?"

## Teaching Guide

Intro: Pig Latin is a way of manipulating the English language to create a "coded language" often spoken by children.

Demo:
Consonants - hello, throw, yummy
Vowels - every, ox, always
Q-words - quick, quiet, squeal
Sometimes "y" - fry, spy

Mob Programming: How to be a good mob programmer, why mob programming, challenges, take breaks

Step by step set up: write down commands to get the environment set up and where to code

Goal is not to "finish" but to learn and work through challenges with a team



For next cohort: Need to give more guidance with the starter code: break out the function so it doesn't handle the event and start with three or four test words, creating an array of words, mapping over the array of words
