# Challenge
## Challenge One: Getting your bearings

The goal of this challenge is to get you familiar with the boilerplate files in React application generated by create-react-app
- Use create-react-app to create a project.
- Find App.js and make some changes to the existing some content.
- Find App.css and change some styles.
- Find index.html and change the title of the page.

The next two challenges will get you familiar with nesting components in a React app generated by create-react-app.

## Challenge Two: About Us Webpage
Now that you are more familiar with the boilerplate React code, it is time to create your own content. You can delete the code in App.js within the outer most <div> of the return.

Here are your stories:
- As a user, I can see a Header component with text 'About Us'
- As a user, I can see a content component with information about you
- As a user, I can see another content component with information about your partner
- As a user, I can see a Footer component with your team name

## Challenge Three: Favorites List
Create a webpage with 3-5 favorites of whatever topic you like (movies, books, tv shows, video games, etc)

Use create-react-app to create a new React project.

- As a user, I can see a component with the title of your app (ie. Top 5 Favorite TV Shows)
- As a user, I can see a component with a list of your favorites
- As a user, I can see a component containing a little blurb about each item on the list
