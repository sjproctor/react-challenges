## Challenge
As a developer, I am tasked with creating a food ordering application in React. This is the first iteration of an application that is going to be much larger in the future, so I am tasked with creating a solid foundation from which the code base can grow.

- As a user, I can see an application that has a list of food items and the price of each item
- As a user, I can select an item I wish to order
- As a user, I can see the items I have selected displayed on the page

#### Stretch Challenges
- As a user, I can see the total cost of my current order
- As a user, I can see both the base total of my food selections and the total that includes sales tax
- As a user, I can see the total that includes sales tax rounded to two decimals
- As a user, I can see an image of my food selection on the menu
