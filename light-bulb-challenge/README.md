# Challenge: Light Bulb

## User Stories
- As a user, I can see a square on the screen with the word `off` in the middle.
- As a user, I can click anywhere on the square. When I click the square the words change from `off` to `on` and then back `off` again.

## Stretch Challenges
- As a user, when I click the box the color goes from white to yellow. The words` on` or `off` are still displayed in the box.

## Super Stretch Challenges
- As a user, instead of seeing a box, I see a picture of a light switch in the off position and a white light bulb.
- As a user, when I click on the light switch it turns on and the light bulb changes from white to yellow.

## Epic Stretch
- As a user, I can see two buttons: 1) Add a Light Switch and 2) Remove a Light Switch.
- As a user, when I click the Add button I can another Light Switch.
- As a user, when I click the Remove button I can delete a Light Switch.
