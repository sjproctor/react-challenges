# Challenge 1 - Light Bulb Challenge
In the terminal, make sure you're on the desktop and use create-react-app plus your project name
- cd into your project
- type atom .
- take out any starter code you want to remove

- As a user I can see a square on the screen with the word 'off' in the middle.
- As a user I can click anywhere on the square. When I click the square the words change from 'off' to 'on' and then back 'off' again.

## Stretch
- As a user, when I click the box the color goes from white to yellow. (still with the words on or off in the middle)

## Super Stretch
- As a user, instead of seeing a box, I see a picture of a light switch in the off position and a white light bulb.

- As a user, when I click on the light switch it turns on and the light bulb changes from white to yellow.

## Epic Stretch
- As a user I see multiple different lightbulbs and switches that act independently of each other.

- As a user I can add or remove a light switch/bulb from the webpage.
