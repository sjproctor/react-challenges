# Madlibs Challenge

## User Stories
- As a user, I can see a page with many text inputs.
- As a user, I can see labels next to the text inputs indicating what part of speech (or type of word) should be entered into each text form: nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adjectives.
- As a user, I can fill out the inputs.
- As a user, after I have filled out the text inputs I can click a 'Submit' button.
- As a user, when I click 'Submit' I see a paragraph appear on the page that contains the words I entered in the text forms to create a funny story.
- As a user, I can click a 'Clear' button that removes the story and the text inputs and returns the page to the original state.
