# Pig Latin Challenge

**Note:** Console.log() are purposely left in the translate function to demonstrate a work flow when solving a complex problem

In this activity we're going to create a Pig Latin application.  We'll use a React application as a template to run the code that we are going to write for Pig Latin.

## Pig Latin Stories
- As a user, I can type in a sentence to the Pig Latin application.
- As a user, when I click Submit, I see a translation of the sentence I entered into Pig Latin.
- As a user, the page is styled, and pleasing to use.

## Speaking Pig Latin

- For words beginning with a vowel, add "way" to the end.
- For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end, and add "ay".
- If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!
- For words beginning with "y", treat "y" as a consonant.
