## Challenge

The goal of the following challenge is for you to practice nesting components and getting familiar with class based component syntax.

Here are your stories:

- As a user, I see a Header component with the name of you cohort
- As a user, I can see a Content component that contains a list of all your classmates
- As a user, I can see a Footer component with the names of you and your partner

Notes:
- This is an HTML file - drag and drop the file icon into a browser
- Add classes to the script tag and import the file in the HelloReact component
