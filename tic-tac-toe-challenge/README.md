# Tic Tac Toe Challenge

## User Stories
- As a user, I can see a 3x3 grid.
- As a user, I should be able to click on a square to mark it with an X.
- As a user, my partner should be able to click on a square after me and see an O.
- As a user, when someone has won the game (3 squares in a row: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), an alert will tell me who has won.
- As a user, if there are no more squares I see an alert that there was no winner.


## Notes: WIP - currently there is no "cat's game" functionality in this code
